## General info
> Simple Search Engine (simpleSearchEngine.kt)

I finished 13 hours of course and get to know a lot of features of Kotlin, developing search engine with three options of search: ALL (result must have all phrases from query) ANY (any word from query) or NONE (cannot have words from query). This app reads list of people from file to List, indexes every seperate word as key in MutableMap, which values are indexes of List where this word is present. One of the features is simple menu with written input as well.
In words of authors of this project:
In this project you will create your own search engine, though it probably won’t compete with Google. Yours will be a simple search engine that processes a limited collection of data and searches it for a word or a phrase. It’ll be simple but cool.

## Inspiration
Willingness to get to know another programming language and to find more challenging job, more amount of free time and JetBrains discount until the end of year (should I also mention that last two are result of COVID?).
