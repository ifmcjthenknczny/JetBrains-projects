## General info
> [Simple Search Engine](https://hyperskill.org/projects/89?track=3) (simpleSearchEngine.kt) (difficulty level: Hard)

I've got to know a lot of features of Kotlin - developing search engine indexing over imported text file, with three options of searching.

> [Seam Carving](https://hyperskill.org/projects/100?track=3) (seamCarving.kt) (difficulty level: Challenging)

This project is focused on manipulating images with the use of Kotlin. Right now I have succesfully created simple image of declared size and inverted colors of imported photo with parameters of input and output declared by command line.

## Inspiration
Willingness to get to know another programming language and to find more challenging job, more amount of free time and JetBrains discount until the end of year (should I also mention that last two are result of COVID?).
