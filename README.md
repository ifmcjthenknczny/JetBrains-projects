Main function of this piece of code takes source path to normal text file. It was succesfully compiled and run in IntelliJ IDEA 2019.3.4.

## Features
> Simple Search Engine (simpleSearchEngine.kt)

* Read data from text file
* Mapping single words to lines indexes where they are in text file

* Printing results of search
* Printing all available data

## Status
Project is: _finished_

## Inspiration
Willingness to get to know another programming language and to find more challenging job, more amount of free time and JetBrains discount until the end of year (should I also mention that last two are result of COVID?).
